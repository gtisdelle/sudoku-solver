Solves a Sudoku puzzle using a backtracking algorithm

This Sudoku solver uses a backtracking algorithm. It was developed to help me further learn python.

Currently the puzzle is hard coded to be the sudoku puzzle from the New York Times on February 1, 2020, but I'm planning to 
exapand it to use an API to generate puzzles.

Sudoku is a classic constraint satisfaction problem and contains a partial candidate solution where it can be quickly and 
trivialy determined whether it can possibly be completed into a valid solution.

I was inspired to solve the problem for a Sudoku board and attained most of my understanding of the backtracking algorithm from
the Wikipedia page on backtracking.
